File_name:Titanic_data_logistic_regression.ipynb.
Dataset:titanic.csv.
Problem Definition:
Explore Titanic dataset and Explore about the people,both those who survived and those who did not,
With today's technology answering questions through data analysis is now easier than ever.

Dataset consist of 891 rows and 12 columns
Each Step is explained in Jupyter Notebook from Data cleaning to Accuracy Checking.
The model is trained using Logistic regression Supervised Learning Algorithm with the accuracy of 78%
using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.

Packages used:
['Matplotlib','Sklearn,'Pandas','Itertools','Seaborn']
